## Requirements

XCode 13 and above. Project is configured to run on iOS 13.0 and above.

## Project architecture

This project is implemented based on MVVM pattern with SwiftUI. 

[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is a framework made by Apple to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit that lets us design apps in a declarative way.
MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, an architecture pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls. It has Model, View and ViewModel separation. 

This project contains UI, Model, Services, Utils and Resources groups.

UI: View and ViewModels are located in the UI Group.

Services & Model: Services represent the network logics of the application and model represents the data.

Utils: are shared between Groups of the application.

Resources: All the other resources of the application is located in Resources.

## Where are dependencies defined?

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects. CocoaPods recursively resolves dependencies between libraries, fetches source code for all dependencies, and creates and maintains an Xcode workspace to build your project. All dependencies of this project are defined in the Podfile located in the root directory of this project.
